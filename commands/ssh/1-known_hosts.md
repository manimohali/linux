The line you provided from the `known_hosts` file is a hashed entry for an SSH known host. When SSH connects to a new host, it stores the host's key in the `~/.ssh/known_hosts` file. By default, these entries are in a plain text format, but SSH can also store them in a hashed format to provide a bit more privacy.

Here's a breakdown of the components of the hashed entry:

### Breakdown of the Hashed Entry

```plaintext
|1|X/B50dAVfbh69/a3Bn+r+MKLecClco=|alMzsGjI2SAt+oQYTJzuCyFJkbk= ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIO1m5M3f2LgsL7FklVfhbvjfhgfev4545HtRMCBymduj6Xg2ur7FUSgsOd
```

1. **Hash Indicator (`|1|`):**
   - The `|1|` indicates that this entry is hashed. The number `1` specifies the hashing method (in this case, it means the entry is hashed).

2. **Salted Hash of the Hostname:**
   - `X/B50dAVfbh69/a3Bn+r+MKLecClco=` is a base64-encoded salted hash of the hostname.

3. **Salt:**
   - `alMzsGjI2SAt+oQYTJzuCyFJkbk=` is the base64-encoded salt used to hash the hostname.

4. **Host Key Type:**
   - `ssh-ed25519` indicates the type of host key (in this case, an ED25519 key).

5. **Host Public Key:**
   - `AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAIO1m5M3f2LgsL7FklVfhbvjfhgfev4545HtRMCBymduj6Xg2ur7FUSgsOd` is the base64-encoded public key of the host.

### Purpose and Usage
- **Hashing Hostnames:** This provides privacy by not storing the actual hostnames/IP addresses in plain text, which can be useful if the `known_hosts` file is exposed.
- **Verification:** When you connect to an SSH server, the client uses the hostname and salt to compute the hash and compare it to the stored hash. If they match, the stored public key is used to verify the host.

### Managing `known_hosts`

- **Adding Entries:** Entries are automatically added when you connect to a new host for the first time and accept its key.
- **Viewing Known Hosts:** You can view entries in the `known_hosts` file with:
  ```bash
  cat ~/.ssh/known_hosts
  ```
- **Removing an Entry:** If you need to remove a specific host (e.g., if the host's key changes), you can use:
  ```bash
  ssh-keygen -R <hostname>
  ```
  Replace `<hostname>` with the actual hostname or IP address.

- **Hashing Control:** To disable hostname hashing (not recommended for privacy reasons):
  ```bash
  ssh-keygen -H -f ~/.ssh/known_hosts
  ```
  This will convert all plain text entries to hashed entries.

By understanding the structure and purpose of hashed entries in the `known_hosts` file, you can manage your SSH known hosts more effectively.
