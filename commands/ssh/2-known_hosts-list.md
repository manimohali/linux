If the hostname or IP address in the `known_hosts` file is hashed (encoded), you can't directly decode it to reveal the original hostname. The hashing used in the `known_hosts` file is a one-way hash function designed to prevent easy reverse-engineering of the original hostname for privacy reasons.

However, you can manage and handle these hashed entries with a few approaches:

### 1. **List All Known Hosts**
To see all known hosts with their corresponding hashed entries, you can use the `ssh-keygen` command to print the contents of the `known_hosts` file. This won’t reveal unhashed hostnames but provides information about all entries.

```bash
ssh-keygen -F hostname_or_ip -f ~/.ssh/known_hosts
```
Example:
```bash
ssh-keygen -F localhost -f ~/.ssh/known_hosts
```


Replace `hostname_or_ip` with the hostname or IP you want to check. This command will show you the entry for that hostname/IP in the `known_hosts` file.

### 2. **Remove or Update Entries**
If you need to manage or clean up specific host entries, you can use `ssh-keygen` to remove them by their hostname or IP address:

```bash
ssh-keygen -R hostname_or_ip
```

This command removes the specified hostname or IP address from the `known_hosts` file.

### 3. **Convert Hashed Entries to Plaintext**
If you have access to the original hostname and want to check if it's already in your `known_hosts` file, you can temporarily disable hostname hashing in your SSH configuration:

1. **Temporarily Disable Hashing:**
   Edit the `~/.ssh/config` file (create it if it doesn't exist) and add:

   ```plaintext
   Host *
       HashKnownHosts no
   ```

   This will disable hashing for new entries. Note that this will not affect the existing hashed entries.

2. **Connect to the Host Again:**
   After disabling hashing, reconnect to the host. It will add a new, plaintext entry to your `known_hosts` file.

3. **Review the `known_hosts` File:**
   Check the `~/.ssh/known_hosts` file for the new entry in plaintext.

### 4. **Using a Script to List Hostnames**
If you need to find a specific hostname in a hashed `known_hosts` file but can't decode it directly, you can write a script to compare known hosts with your current system's resolved IP addresses.

Here’s a basic example in bash:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Path to known_hosts file
KNOWN_HOSTS_FILE=~/.ssh/known_hosts

# List all known hosts
while read -r line; do
    if [[ "$line" == \|* ]]; then
        # Skip hashed lines
        continue
    fi
    host=$(echo "$line" | awk '{print $1}')
    echo "Checking host: $host"
done < "$KNOWN_HOSTS_FILE"
```
