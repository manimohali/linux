Sure! Let's create a simple PHP project, upload it to GitHub, and set up a CI/CD pipeline in Jenkins to deploy it to a remote server.

### Step 1: Create a Simple PHP Project

1. **Create Project Directory:**
   ```sh
   mkdir demo-php-project
   cd demo-php-project
   ```

2. **Create a Simple PHP File:**
   ```php
   <?php
   // index.php
   echo "Hello, World!";
   ```
   Save this content in a file named `index.php`.

3. **Create a Readme File:**
   ```markdown
   # Demo PHP Project
   This is a simple PHP project for demonstrating CI/CD with Jenkins.
   ```
   Save this content in a file named `README.md`.

4. **Create a Directory for Deployment Script:**
   ```sh
   mkdir scripts
   ```

5. **Create a Deployment Script:**
   ```sh
   # scripts/deploy.sh
   echo "Deploying to remote server..."
   scp -r * user@remote-server:/path/to/deploy
   ssh user@remote-server 'cd /path/to/deploy && echo "Deployed Successfully!"'
   ```
   Replace `user` with your SSH username and `remote-server` with your remote server address.

### Step 2: Initialize Git and Push to GitHub

1. **Initialize Git Repository:**
   ```sh
   git init
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   ```

2. **Create a GitHub Repository:**
   - Go to GitHub and create a new repository named `demo-php-project`.

3. **Add GitHub Remote and Push:**
   ```sh
   git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/demo-php-project.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

### Step 3: Configure Jenkins for CI/CD

1. **Open Jenkins Dashboard:**
   - Go to your Jenkins dashboard in your web browser (usually `http://localhost:8080`).

2. **Install Required Plugins:**
   - Click on **"Manage Jenkins"**.
   - Select **"Manage Plugins"**.
   - Go to the **"Available"** tab.
   - Search for **"Git Plugin"** and install it.
   - Search for **"Publish Over SSH"** and install it.

3. **Add SSH Credentials:**
   - Go to **"Manage Jenkins"** -> **"Configure System"**.
   - Scroll down to **"Publish over SSH"** and add your remote server details.

4. **Create a New Jenkins Job:**
   - From the Jenkins dashboard, click on **"New Item"**.
   - Enter `demo-php-project` as the name.
   - Select **"Freestyle project"** and click **"OK"**.

5. **Configure Source Code Management:**
   - In the job configuration page, scroll down to the **"Source Code Management"** section.
   - Select **"Git"**.
   - Enter the URL of your GitHub repository (e.g., `https://github.com/your-username/demo-php-project.git`).

6. **Set Up Build Triggers:**
   - Scroll down to the **"Build Triggers"** section.
   - Check **"GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling"**.

7. **Add Build Steps:**
   - Scroll down to the **"Build"** section.
   - Click on **"Add build step"**.
   - Select **"Execute shell"**.
   - Enter the shell commands to deploy your project:
     ```sh
     ./scripts/deploy.sh
     ```

8. **Save and Build:**
   - Click **"Save"**.
   - Click **"Build Now"** to manually trigger a build and ensure everything is working.

### Step 4: Configure GitHub Webhook

1. **Set Up Webhook in GitHub:**
   - Go to your GitHub repository.
   - Click on **"Settings"**.
   - Select **"Webhooks"**.
   - Click on **"Add webhook"**.
   - Enter the Jenkins URL with `/github-webhook/` endpoint (e.g., `http://your-jenkins-url/github-webhook/`).
   - Set the content type to **"application/json"**.
   - Select **"Just the push event"**.

### Final Step: Test the Pipeline

1. **Push Changes to GitHub:**
   - Make any changes to your project locally and push them to GitHub:
     ```sh
     git add .
     git commit -m "Updated project"
     git push
     ```

2. **Check Jenkins:**
   - Go to your Jenkins dashboard and verify that the new build is triggered automatically.
   - Check the build logs to ensure the deployment script ran successfully.

By following these steps, you have created a simple PHP project, uploaded it to GitHub, and configured Jenkins to deploy it to a remote server whenever changes are pushed to the `main` branch.
