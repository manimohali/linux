Yes, you can duplicate your current pane in `tmux` without needing to log in again by using the `split-window` command with the `-d` option to duplicate the pane. Here's how you can do it:

1. **Split the Pane**:
   - To split the current pane horizontally:
     ```bash
     Ctrl + b then "
     ```
   - To split the current pane vertically:
     ```bash
     Ctrl + b then %
     ```

2. **Duplicate the Current Pane**:
   - To duplicate the current pane exactly, you can use the `split-window` command with the `-d` (duplicate) option:
     ```bash
     Ctrl + b then :
     ```
   - Then type the following command and press `Enter`:
     ```bash
     split-window -h -d
     ```
     or
     ```bash
     split-window -v -d
     ```
   - The `-h` option splits the window horizontally and the `-v` option splits it vertically.

3. **Send Keys to the New Pane**:
   - To send the command that was running in the original pane to the new pane, you can use the `send-keys` command. For example, if the original command was `top`, you can do:
     ```bash
     Ctrl + b then :
     ```
   - Then type the following command and press `Enter`:
     ```bash
     send-keys -t <target-pane> 'top' C-m
     ```
   - Replace `<target-pane>` with the pane identifier (e.g., `0.1` for window 0, pane 1).

Here is a full example:

1. **Split the current pane horizontally**:
   ```bash
   Ctrl + b then "
   ```

2. **Enter command mode to duplicate**:
   ```bash
   Ctrl + b then :
   ```

3. **Duplicate the pane**:
   ```bash
   split-window -h -d
   ```

4. **Send keys to the new pane**:
   ```bash
   Ctrl + b then :
   ```
   ```bash
   send-keys -t 0.1 'top' C-m
   ```

Replace `top` with whatever command you want to run in the new pane. This way, you donâ€™t need to log in again, and you can continue working in both panes independently.
